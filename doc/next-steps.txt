1. Definition of our data model ... 

2. ``Wrapping'' Drools offering interfaces to
- specify data and data model (Factory) ... ``Facts''
- insert and query data (DroolsManager) ... ``Rules''

3. Test and Benchmarking

4. We needs to be improved and/or integrated? 
- Conjunction of rules ...
- Data types (depending on our design decision => utilization of Java types (Objects))
- negative hard and soft constraints, positive constraints
negative hard ... MUST be fulfilled
negative soft ... SHOULD be fulfilled
positive      ... CAN be fulfulled 
- SBOL integration ... MUST be done before we publish/release the prototype
can we formulate the SBOL data model?

6. ``real world'' Case Studies


6.1. Specification and Acquisition (using SBOL) of ``real'' data ... 
- iGEM partsregisty
- JBEI ICE 
- SBPkb
- Clotho
- ...

6.2. Data Acquisition of
- BROAD (Eric Y.) -> potential first human user...
- Phoenix (Evan)  -> first software that will connect to
