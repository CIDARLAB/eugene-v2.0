/** NEXT STEPS: 
- specification of the chemical (e.g. ara, aTc, ...)
- specification of the chemical's concentration unit ()
- optional induction values
- can we parse the key-file? or can Eugene offer a syntax for characterization data similar to the key file?

e.g.
Device L2Ar(
    pConst, AracC, pBad, pTet, RFPc, pConst, TetRc)
